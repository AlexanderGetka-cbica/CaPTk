# History

CaPTk used to be hosted on another website that used SVN for it's version control. The number of revisions/objects it had was so massive GitHub wouldn't accept the repo created by `git-svn` so a compromise was made where this repo would start fresh, yet contain the svn history here if anyone needed it.
