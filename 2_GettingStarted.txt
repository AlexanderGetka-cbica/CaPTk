/**
\page gs_components "Components"
CaPTk has been designed as a modular platform, currently incorporating components for:
-# User interaction (e.g., coordinate definition, region annotation, and spherical approximation of abnormalities)
-# Image pre-processing (e.g., smoothing, bias correction, co-registration, skull-stripping, normalization) 
-# Image segmentation
-# Feature extraction
-# Specialized diagnostic analysis. 

The components of interaction and pre-processing are available for all integrated applications giving a researcher (whether clinical or computational) a single point of entry and exit for all their tasks.

/**
\page gs_supportedImages "Supported Images"
Currently, CaPTk supports visualization of <b>MR, CT, PET, X-Ray and Digital Mammography </b> images in both NIfTI (i.e., <b>.nii</b>, <b>.nii.gz</b>) and DICOM (i.e., <b>.dcm</b>) formats. For MRI, the following modalities are currently supported:
-# <b>Native T1-weighted</b>
-# <b>Post-contrast T1-weighted</b> (T1-Gd, also known as T1c, and T1-CE)
-# <b>T2-weighted</b>
-# <b>T2-weighted Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery</b> (T2-FLAIR)
-# <b>Dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced</b> (DSC)
-# <b>Diffusion Tensor Imaging</b> (DTI) *
-# <b>Diffusion Weighted Imaging</b> (DWI) *

<b>*</b> These modalities are currently visualized only via Confetti.

In addition, CaPTk offers the ability to extract and visualize commonly used measurements from DTI [1] and DSC-MRI, while accounting for leakage correction [2]. The exact measurements supported are:
<ul>
<li><b>DTI-FA</b> (Fractional Anisotropy)</li>
<li><b>DTI-AX</b> (Axial Diffusivity)</li>
<li><b>DTI-RAD</b> (Radial Diffusivity)</li>
<li><b>DTI-ADC</b> (Apparent Diffusion Coefficient)</li>
<li><b>DSC-rCBV</b> (relative Cerebral Blood Volume)</li>
<li><b>DSC-PH</b> (Peak Height)</li>
<li><b>DSC-PSR</b> (Percentage Signal Recovery)</li>
</ul>

For every loaded image, the modality is automatically assigned using information from the filename (for NIfTI format). In case of discrepancy, the user can use the drop-down modality switcher (see below) to revise accordingly. This is typically needed in the <a href="ht_SpecialApps.html">Specialized Applications</a>.

\page gs_imageVisualization "Image Visualization"
Sliders on each visualization panel (highlighted in green in the figure below) control the movement across respective axes. Note that in DSC-MRI, the single horizontal slider (highlighted in yellow) moves across the time of the acquired dynamic scan.
<br>
Various adjustments are available to the user, including:
-# contrast/brightness: right mouse button click + horizontal/vertical drag on any visualization panel, respectively.
-# windowing of intensities and setting of different visualization type: bottom-right panel.

The bottom-left panel of CaPTk (highlighted in red) shows basic information about the image and the position of the cross-hair. In the visualization panes, the "Z" axis is the center; and "Y" and "X" are to its left and right, respectively. "Z" represents the Axial view for RAI-to-LPS images.

/**
\page gs_preprocessing "Pre-processing"
An essential component for quantitative image analysis is the appropriate pre-processing steps. The related CaPTk tools available for this purpose are fully-parameterizable and comprise:
<ul>
<li><b>Denoising.</b> Intensity noise reduction in regions of uniform intensity profile is offered through a low-level image processing method, namely Smallest Univalue Segment Assimilating Nucleus (SUSAN) [1]. This is a custom implementation and does <b>NOT</b> call out to the original implementation distributed by FSL.</li>
<li><b>Bias correction.</b> Correction for magnetic field inhomogeneity is provided using a non-parametric non-uniform intensity normalization [2].</li>
<li><b>Co-registration.</b> Registration of various images to the same anatomical template, for examining anatomically aligned imaging signals in tandem and at the voxel level, is offered by the ITK module ITKRegistrationCommon (i.e., a combination of itk::MattesMutualInformationImageToImageMetric, itk::RegularStepGradientDescentOptimizerv4, and itk::MultiResolutionImageRegistrationMethod).</li>
<li><b>Skull-Stripping (Brain Extraction).</b> Removing the bone structure in brain scans is performed using the ITK filter itk::StripTsImageFilter [3].</li>
<li><b>Intensity normalization.</b> Conversion of signals across modalities are converted to comparable quantities using histogram matching [4].</li>
</ul>

/**
\page gs_seedpoints "Coordinate definition (Seed-point initialization)"
The <b>Seed Points</b> tab includes two general types of initialization (i.e., tumor and tissue points), controlled by the respective radio buttons. 

\image html gettingStarted/seeds_resize.png "Seed point initialization"
\image latex gettingStarted/seeds_resize.png "Seed point initialization"

Loading and saving is done via text files in a format consistent with respective applications. Seedpoint files are needed for the following applications (and all derivatives): <a href="https://www.cbica.upenn.edu/sbia/software/glistr/">GLISTR</a> [1-3], <a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/sbia/glistrboost.html">GLISTRboost</a> (BraTS 2015 top-ranked algorithm) [4-6], and <a href="https://www.cbica.upenn.edu/sbia/software/portr/">PORTR</a> [7].

The controls to add/remove points are the shown below.

--------
### Tumor Points
These are seed-points used to approximate a tumor by a parametric spherical model, using a seed-point for its center and another for defining its radius. These are helpful for applications like tumor growth model estimation. The controls are as follows:
<table border="0">
  <tr><th>Key Stroke <th>Function
  <tr><td align="center" width="100px">Shift + Space <td align="center">Set initial tumor center
  <tr><td align="center">Ctrl + Space <td align="center">Update tumor radius
  <tr><td align="center">Space <td align="center">Update tumor center
</table>

--------
### Tissue Points
These are seed-points with coordinate information. They can be used for a multitude of applications where manual initialization(s) are required for a semi-automated algorithm, e.g, segmentation. At the moment these points are being assigned various brain tissue labels, as follows:
<table border="0">
  <tr><th>Tissue Acronym <th>Full Form
  <tr><td align="center">CSF <td align="center">Cerebrospinal Fluid
  <tr><td align="center">VT <td align="center">Ventricular Cerebrospinal Fluid
  <tr><td align="center">GM <td align="center">Gray Matter
  <tr><td align="center">WM <td align="center">White Matter
  <tr><td align="center">VS <td align="center">Vessels
  <tr><td align="center">ED <td align="center">Edema
  <tr><td align="center">NCR <td align="center">Necrosis
  <tr><td align="center">TU <td align="center">Enhancing Tumor
  <tr><td align="center">NE <td align="center">Non-Enhancing Tumor
  <tr><td align="center">CB <td align="center">Cerebellum
  <tr><td align="center">CAE <td align="center">Enhancing Cavity
  <tr><td align="center">CAN <td align="center">Non-Enhancing Cavity
  <tr><td align="center">RTN <td align="center">Tumor Recurrence
  <tr><td align="center">RTE <td align="center">Enhanced Tumor Recurrence
</table>

--------
Application-specific tissue types are automatically enabled when the corresponding application is selected. For example, when trying to initialize tissue points for GLISTR/GLISTRboost, only CSF, GM, WM, VS, ED, NCR, TU, NE and CB buttons will be enabled and the rest will be disabled. If there are some required tissue types missing for an application, CaPTk will display a warning and not let the user save the incorrect tissue points.

/**
\page gs_features "Feature Extraction"
The feature extraction tab in CaPTk enables clinicians and other researchers to easily extract feature measurements, commonly used in image analysis, and conduct large-scale analyses in a repeatable manner.

\image html gettingStarted/featurepanel_resize.png "Feature Panel screenshot"
\image latex gettingStarted/featurepanel_resize.png "Feature Panel screenshot"

Although the feature panel in CaPTk is continuously expanding, it currently comprises i) intensity-based, ii) textural (GLCM, GLRLM, GLSZM, NGTDM, LBP), and iii) volumetric/morphologic features. You can find the exact list of features incorporated in CaPTk, together with their mathematical definition in the </a href="ht_FeatureExtraction.html">corresponding How-To Guide</a>.

The specialized applications in CaPTk, such as the "EGFRvIII Surrogate Index", "Survival Prediction", "Recurrence Estimator", and "SBRT-Lung" use features of this panel. However, the general idea is to keep the features generic and adaptable for different types of images by just changing the input parameters. For now we provide some pre-selected parameters for Neuro and Torso images (i.e., Brain, Breast, Lung). Users can alter these pre-selected values through the <b>Custom</b> menu option, or create their own set of parameters via the <b>Advanced</b> menu. The <b>output</b> of the feature extraction tab is a <b>.csv</b> file, with feature names and values. Note that the reported features are extracted per modality, per annotated region and per offset (offset represents the radius around the center pixel; for radius 1, the offset will be +/- 1) value.
