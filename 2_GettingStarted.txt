/**
\page gs_components Components
CaPTk has been designed as a modular platform, currently incorporating components for:
-# User interaction (e.g., coordinate definition, region annotation, and spherical approximation of abnormalities)
-# Image pre-processing (e.g., smoothing, bias correction, co-registration, normalization) 
-# Image segmentation
-# Feature extraction
-# Specialized diagnostic analysis 

The components of interaction and pre-processing are available for all integrated applications giving a researcher (whether clinical or computational) a single point of entry and exit for all their tasks.

/**
\page gs_supportedImages Supported Images
Currently, CaPTk supports visualization of <b>MR, CT, PET, X-Ray and Full-field Digital Mammography (FFDM) </b> images in both NIfTI (i.e., <b>.nii</b>, <b>.nii.gz</b>) and DICOM (i.e., <b>.dcm</b>) formats. For MRI, the following modalities are currently supported (the image modality box equivalent is shown in parenthesis):
-# <b>Native T1-weighted</b> (T1)
-# <b>Post-contrast T1-weighted</b> (T1-Gd, also known as T1c, and T1-CE)
-# <b>T2-weighted</b> (T2)
-# <b>T2-weighted Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery</b> (T2-FLAIR)
-# <b>Dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced</b> (DSC or PERFUSION)
-# <b>Diffusion Tensor Imaging</b> (DTI) *
-# <b>Diffusion Weighted Imaging</b> (DWI) *
-# <b>Recurrence Maps</b> (REC)

<b>*</b> These modalities are currently visualized only within the "Confetti" application.

In addition, CaPTk offers the ability to extract and visualize commonly used measurements from DTI [1] and DSC-MRI, while accounting for leakage correction [2]. The exact measurements supported are:
<ul>
  <li><b>DTI-FA</b> (Fractional Anisotropy)</li>
  <li><b>DTI-AX</b> (Axial Diffusivity)</li>
  <li><b>DTI-RAD</b> (Radial Diffusivity)</li>
  <li><b>DTI-TR</b> (Trace)</li>
  <li><b>DSC-ap-rCBV</b> (automatically-extracted proxy to relative Cerebral Blood Volume)</li>
  <li><b>DSC-PH</b> (Peak Height)</li>
  <li><b>DSC-PSR</b> (Percentage Signal Recovery)</li>
</ul>

/**
\page gs_imageLoading Image Loading
The <b>File -> Load</b> menu is used to load all image types.

\image html imageLoading_resize.png "Loading images for visualization/processing"
\image latex imageLoading_resize.png "Loading images for visualization/processing"

--------
For every loaded NIfTI image, the modality is automatically assigned using information from the filename. To <b> assign modalities </b> for DICOM images, or in case of a discrepancy in the modality of a NIfTI image, the user can use the drop-down modality switcher (see below) to revise the modality accordingly. This is typically needed in the <a href="ht_SpecialApps.html">Specialized Applications</a>.

/**
\page gs_imageVisualization Image Visualization
Sliders on each visualization panel (highlighted in green in the figure below) control the movement across respective axes. Note that in DSC-MRI, the single horizontal slider (highlighted in yellow) moves across the time of the acquired dynamic scan.
<br>
Various adjustments are available to the user, including:
-# contrast/brightness: right mouse button click + horizontal/vertical drag on any visualization panel, respectively.
-# windowing of intensities and setting of different visualization type: bottom-right panel.
-# zooming into the image via Ctrl + mouse wheel.

The bottom-left panel of CaPTk (highlighted in red) shows basic information about the image and the position of the cross-hair. In the visualization panes, the "Z" axis is the center; and "Y" and "X" are to its left and right, respectively. "Z" represents the Axial view for RAI-to-LPS images. 


\image html sliders_resize.png "Visualization Sliders and Image Information"
\image latex sliders_resize.png "Visualization Sliders and Image Information"


The "Overlay" functionality enables the visualization between two loaded images:

-# Double-click one of the two images you want to visualize and then click on its corresponding "overlay" radio button, on its right-most column.
-# Click on the "overlay" radio button of the second image that you want to visualize.
-# Both "Overlay" and "Underlay" images are now visualized with 50% opacity.
-# Check the tick box "Change Opacity".
-# Moving the slider changes the opacity between the "Overlay" and the "Underlay" images.

/**
\page gs_tabDocking Tab Docking (Windows-only)
Double clicking on the tab bar will dock/undock the entire section, resulting in larger visualization panels in your monitor. This behavior is replicated by single click of the dock/undock button at the end of the section as well.

/**
\page gs_preprocessing Pre-processing
Image pre-processing is essential to quantitative image analysis. CaPTk pre-processing tools available under the "Preprocessing" menu are fully-parameterizable and comprise:
<ul>
  <li><b>Denoising.</b> Intensity noise reduction in regions of uniform intensity profile is offered through a low-level image processing method, namely Smallest Univalue Segment Assimilating Nucleus (SUSAN) [1]. This is a custom implementation and does <b>NOT</b> call out to the original implementation distributed by FSL.</li>
  <li><b>Co-registration.</b> Registration of various images to the same anatomical template, for examining anatomically aligned imaging signals in tandem and at the voxel level, is done using the Greedy Registration algorithm [5].</li>
  <li><b>Bias correction.</b> Correction for magnetic field inhomogeneity is provided using a non-parametric non-uniform intensity normalization [2].</li>
  <li><b>Intensity normalization.</b> Conversion of signals across modalities to comparable quantities using histogram matching [4].</li>
  <li><b>DeepMedic normalization.</b> Images are normalized using a z-scoring mechanism with option to do the normalization within the region of interest or across the entire image. In addition, there is an option to remove outliers & noise from the image by removing a certain percentage of the top and bottom intensity ranges [6].</li>
</ul>

/**
\page gs_seedpoints Coordinate definition (Seed-point initialization)
The <b>Seed Points</b> tab includes two general types of initialization (i.e., tumor and tissue points), controlled by the respective radio buttons. 

\image html seeds_resize.png "Seed point initialization"
\image latex seeds_resize.png "Seed point initialization"

Loading and saving is done via text files in a format consistent with respective applications. Seedpoint files are needed for the following applications (and all derivatives): GLISTR (https://www.cbica.upenn.edu/sbia/software/glistr/) [1-3], GLISTRboost (BraTS 2015 top-ranked algorithm - https://www.med.upenn.edu/sbia/glistrboost.html) [4-6], and PORTR (https://www.cbica.upenn.edu/sbia/software/portr/) [7].

The controls to add/remove points are the shown below.

--------
### Tumor Points
These are seed-points used to approximate a tumor by a parametric spherical model, using a seed-point for its center and another for defining its radius. These are helpful for applications like tumor growth model estimation as currently incorporated in GLISTR and GLISTRboost. The controls are as follows:

<table border="0">
  <tr><th>Key Stroke <th>Function
  <tr><td align="center" width="100px">Shift + Space <td align="center">Set initial tumor center
  <tr><td align="center">Ctrl + Space <td align="center">Update tumor radius
  <tr><td align="center">Space <td align="center">Update tumor center
</table>

--------
### Tissue Points
These are seed-points with coordinate information. They can be used for a multitude of applications where manual initialization(s) are required for a semi-automated algorithm, e.g, segmentation. At the moment these points are being assigned various brain tissue labels, as follows:
<table border="0">
  <tr><th>Tissue Acronym <th>Full Form
  <tr><td align="center">CSF <td align="center">Cerebrospinal Fluid
  <tr><td align="center">VT <td align="center">Ventricular Cerebrospinal Fluid
  <tr><td align="center">GM <td align="center">Gray Matter
  <tr><td align="center">WM <td align="center">White Matter
  <tr><td align="center">VS <td align="center">Vessels
  <tr><td align="center">ED <td align="center">Edema
  <tr><td align="center">NCR <td align="center">Necrosis
  <tr><td align="center">TU <td align="center">Enhancing Tumor
  <tr><td align="center">NE <td align="center">Non-Enhancing Tumor
  <tr><td align="center">CB <td align="center">Cerebellum
  <tr><td align="center">CAE <td align="center">Enhancing Cavity
  <tr><td align="center">CAN <td align="center">Non-Enhancing Cavity
  <tr><td align="center">RTN <td align="center">Tumor Recurrence
  <tr><td align="center">RTE <td align="center">Enhanced Tumor Recurrence
</table>

--------
Application-specific tissue types are automatically enabled when the corresponding application is selected. For example, when trying to initialize tissue points for GLISTR/GLISTRboost, only CSF, GM, WM, VS, ED, NCR, TU, NE and CB buttons will be enabled and the rest will be disabled. If there are some required tissue types missing for an application, CaPTk will display a warning and not let the user save an incomplete set of tissue points.

/**
\page gs_features Feature Extraction
The feature extraction tab in CaPTk enables clinicians and other researchers to easily extract feature measurements, commonly used in image analysis, and conduct large-scale analyses in a repeatable manner.

\image html featurepanel_resize.png "Feature Panel screenshot"
\image latex featurepanel_resize.png "Feature Panel screenshot"

Although the feature panel in CaPTk is continuously expanding, it currently comprises i) intensity-based, ii) textural (GLCM, GLRLM, GLSZM, NGTDM, LBP), and iii) volumetric/morphologic features. You can find the exact list of features incorporated in CaPTk, together with their mathematical definition in the <a href="ht_FeatureExtraction.html">corresponding How-To section</a>.

Specialized applications in CaPTk, such as "EGFRvIII Surrogate Index", "Survival Prediction", "Recurrence Estimator", and "SBRT-Lung" use features of this panel. However, the general idea is to keep the features generic and adaptable for different types of images by just changing the input parameters. Currently we provide some pre-selected parameters for Neuro and Torso images (i.e., Brain, Breast, Lung). Users can alter these pre-selected values through the <b>Custom</b> menu option, or create their own set of parameters via the <b>Advanced</b> menu. The <b>output</b> of the feature extraction tab is a text (<b>.csv</b>) file, with feature names and values. Note that the reported features are extracted per modality, per annotated region and per offset (offset represents the radius around the center pixel; for radius 1, the offset will be +/- 1) value.
