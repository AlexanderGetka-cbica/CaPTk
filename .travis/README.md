# .Travis

Contains the scripts used by Travis CI to do continuous integration. These scripts are NOT intended for users or developers to build CaPTk with. They provide an intensely stripped back and minimalistic configuration and build of CaPTk with very strange restrictions (no FTP connections for example) due to the way Travis CI behaves. You have been warned.
