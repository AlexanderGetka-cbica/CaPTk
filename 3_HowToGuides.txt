\page ht_Segmentation Segmentation

## Geodesic Distance Transform-based Segmentation
The geodesic distance transform based segmentation is a semi-automatic technique to delineate structures of distinct intensity.

<b> REQUIREMENTS:</b>
A single image with distinct boundaries for the structure that needs to be segmented [1].

<b> USAGE:</b>
	-# Using Label 1 from the drawing tab, annotate a continuous region of the tissue you would like to segment in the image.
	-# After that, select "Geodesic Segmentation" from the Applications menu.
	-# The mask is populated within ~5 minutes.
	- This application is also available as with a stand-alone CLI for data analysts to build pipelines around, and can run in the following format:
	\verbatim
	GeodesicSegmentation.exe -i C:/inputImage.nii.gz -m C:/maskWithOneLabel.nii.gz -o C:/outputImage.nii.gz -t 20
	\endverbatim

## ITK-SNAP
<a href="http://www.itksnap.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php">ITK-SNAP</a> is a stand-alone software application used to segment structures in 3D medical images and other utilities [2].

Within CaPTk specifically, ITK-SNAP is tightly integrated as a tool used for segmentation, accepting files chosen through the CaPTk interface and returning results for further use within CaPTk. ITK-SNAP uses a combination of random forests and level sets to obtain precise segmentations of structures [2]. Please see the following video for detailed instructions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gBcFxKf-7Q

/**
\page Glioblastoma_Confetti "Glioblastoma: Confetti"
This is a method for automated extraction of white matter tracts of interest in a consistent and comparable manner over a large group of subjects without drawing the inclusion and exclusion ROIs, facilitating an easy correspondence between different subjects, as well as providing a representation that is robust to edema, mass effect, and tract infiltration [1-3]. Confetti includes three main steps: 
-# Connectivity signature generation for fibers
-# Clustering of fibers using a mixture of multinomials (MNs) clustering method and Expectation-Maximization (EM) optimization framework
-# Extraction of predefined white matter tracts. 

<b>REQUIREMENTS:</b>
	-# Fiber set (Streamline) to be clustered: The fiber set can be generated using any tractography model, but the file should be saved in .Bfloat format (i.e. fiber format of Camino package). Different converters can be be used to convert .trk to .Bfloat and vice-versa.
	-# Track Density Images (TDI): When using GUI, it needs to be generated in the manner explained below; this constraint is not present when using Confetti via the command line.
	-# Parcellation of the brain into 87 Desikan/Freesurfer gray matter (GM) regions [4]

	<b>Generation of TDI Images with GUI:</b>
	-# Freesurfer [4] is used with the Desikan atlas [5] to define 87 gray matter ROIs in the user diffusion space. 
	-# Region IDs of the ROIs as used by Freesurfer is provided in the example file "{CaPTk_Sample_Data}/Confetti/input/freesurfer_ROIs.csv". 
	-# TDIs must be generated using the probtrackx utility of FSL package [6] with its default parameters and 5000 seeds per voxel. 
	-# Each TDI image is a whole brain voxel-map, with each voxel having the number of fibers passing through this voxel and reaching to one of the 87 gray matter ROIs defined by Freesurfer. 
	-# In total, you should have 87 TDI, each corresponding to one ROI. 

<b>USAGE:</b>
	-# Open Confetti UI using the 'Applications -> Confetti' menu option.
	-# Load the required images using "Streamline File" and "TDI Directory".
	-# Specify the output directory and click on 'Run Confetti'.
	-# Visually review the output tracks by double clicking respective fields on the populated list view.
	- This application is also available as with a stand-alone CLI for data analysts to build pipelines around, using the following example commands:
	-# Generation of connectivity signatures of the fibers that will be clustered into bundles:<br>
	\verbatim
	Confetti signature -i tdi_paths_freesurfer_87ROIs.csv -f fibers.Bfloat -o signatures.csv
	\endverbatim
	-# Clustering of the generated fibers into bundles:<br>
	\verbatim
	Confetti cluster -s signatures.csv -k 200 -o clusterIDs.csv
	\endverbatim
	-# Identification of specific tracts (requires an annotated example):<br>
	\verbatim
	Confetti extract -t template/ -f fibers.Bfloat -c clusterIDs.csv -o tracts_

\page BreastCancer_LIBRA "Breast Cancer: Breast Density Estimation (LIBRA)"
The Laboratory for Individualized Breast Radiodensity Assessment (LIBRA) is a stand-alone software application for fully-automated breast density segmentation. LIBRA is based on a published algorithm [1] that works on either raw (i.e., "FOR PROCESSING") or vendor post-processed (i.e., "FOR PRESENTATION") digital mammography images from two vendors (GE Healthcare and Hologic) and it generates quantitative estimates of breast area, dense area and breast percent density.
 
Within CaPTk specifically, LIBRA is available via an easy-to-use interactive mode with Graphical-User-Interface where the user is prompted to select either a single DICOM image or a folder of DICOM images, an output folder for the results, and whether they wish to save intermediate files. All results are stored in the output folder defined by the user.
 
Please see the LIBRA manual for detailed instructions: http://www.med.upenn.edu/sbia/libra.html

\page LungCancer_SBRT "Lung Cancer: Radiomics Analysis of Lung Cancer (SBRT Lung)"
This application calculates quantitative imaging measures including Intensity statistics, GLCM, GLRLM, LBP, and shape features from PET/CT scans of lung cancer patients for predicting clinical outcomes, such as treatment response and patient survival using pattern recognition and machine learning techniques [19]. It consists of 2 steps: 'Segment' and 'Analyze'.

<b>REQUIREMENTS:</b>
	-# CT image
	-# PET image (co-registered to the CT image)

<b>USAGE:</b>
	-# Once the images have been loaded, click on 'SBRT Segment' from the 'Applications' menu. Note that the segmentation needs to be run before the analysis.
	-# The mask is automatically loaded. Please correct the mask as required (it should ideally cover the lesions in the lung).
	-# Click on 'SBRT Analyze' from the 'Applications' menu.
	-# The prediction result comes up in a pop-up box.

NOTE: SBRT uses a pre-trained model for estimation; in the future we will provide a mechanism to do training on own data.
