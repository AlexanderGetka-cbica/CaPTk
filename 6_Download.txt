\page Download Download Instructions

Visit our <b>Download Page</b> hosted in NIH-supported NITRC (https://www.nitrc.org/frs/?group_id=1059), to download the CaPTk <b>source code</b> and <b>binaries</b>.

CaPTk is currently distributed in the form of pre-compiled (executable) Windows installer, as well as in the form of its source code. We are actively working on producing pre-compiled binaries for Linux and macOS machines too. The Windows executable package contains all required dependencies and does not need administrative privileges for installation.

The Linux executable assumes Qt 4.8.x installed on the system and in the PATH and was built using GCC 4.8.6 (default with Ubuntu 14.04); the custom path for installation can be specified using the following command: 

\verbatim
$package --target $desiredInstallDir
\endverbatim

<b>NOTE:</b> For Linux users, the following packages are needed to install the binary: <b>wget zip</b>. As an example, the installation command on Ubuntu for these packages will be:
\verbatim
sudo apt-get install wget zip
\endverbatim
