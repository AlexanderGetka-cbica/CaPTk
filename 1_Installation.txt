\page Installation Installation Instructions

## Windows

The Windows executable package contains all required dependencies and does not need administrative privileges for installation. This is a standard MSI installer. If a security prompt comes up, click on "Run Anyway".

## Linux

Linux users have a CaPTk AppImage available called `CaPTk_${Version}.bin`. To run the AppImage, first open a terminal in the same directory as the .bin file.

After this, you will want to make sure it is runnable with the following command:

\verbatim
chmod +x CaPTk.bin
\endverbatim

After this, in the same terminal, run the following command to start CaPTk:

\verbatim
./CaPTk.bin
\endverbatim

## macOS

Users will download the ".pkg" file from NITRC; double-click the file. 

If there is a window saying that this is an "unidentified developer", hit "OK" and then go to "System Preferences > Security and Privacy" and you need to click on "Open Anyway" beside the "CaPTk_$version.pkg" (this will prompt for your password).

Double click on the pkg file and click on "Open". This will guide you through the installation screen with licensing information.

Before installation begins, you may be prompted for your password again.

You will find CaPTk under your "Applications" folder and you can delete the disk image.
