\page Installation Installation Instructions

## Windows

The Windows executable package contains all required dependencies and does not need administrative privileges for installation.

## Linux

Linux users have a CaPTk AppImage available called `CaPTk_${Version}.bin`. To run the AppImage, first open a terminal in the same directory as the .bin file.

After this, you will want to make sure it is runnable with the following command:

\verbatim
chmod +x CaPTk.bin
\endverbatim

After this, in the same terminal, run the following command to start CaPTk:

\verbatim
./CaPTk.bin
\endverbatim

## macOS

For macOS users, we urge users to use the "Low Resolution" mode for the application. To do this, follow these instructions:

- Open the <b>CaPTk_${Version}.dmg</b> file (a Window should pop up with <b>CaPTk.app</b> inside)
- Move the <b>CaPTk.app</b> into your <b>Applications</b> folder
- Right click <b>CaPTk.app</b>
- Click on <b>Get Info</b>
- Select the box <b>Open in Low Resolution</b> 
- Open <b>CaPTk.app</b> as usual
