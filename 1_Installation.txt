\page Installation Installation Instructions

## Windows

The Windows executable package contains all required dependencies and does not need administrative privileges for installation.

## Linux

The Linux installer is a shell script that can be executed under the "sh" shell, as in:

\verbatim
sh CaPTk_{versionNumber}.sh
\endverbatim

The shell script will install CaPTk to the current directory by default. This can be changed by specifying the directory with the option "--target", as in:

\verbatim
sh CaPTk_{versionNumber}.sh --target /my/preferred/folder/CaPTk/release_1.5
\endverbatim

Once installed, the CaPTk executable will be in the "bin" subdirectory of the installation directory, and can be run by giving the command-name, as in:

\verbatim
/my/preferred/folder/CaPTk/release_1.5/bin/captk
\endverbatim

<b>Note</b> that the installer assumes Qt 4.8.x installed on the system and in the PATH, and was built using GCC 4.8.6 (default with Ubuntu 14.04); the custom path for installation can be specified using the following command: 

\verbatim
$package --target $desiredInstallDir
\endverbatim

The following packages are also needed to install the binary: <b>libqtwebkit4 wget zip</b>. As an example, the installation command on Ubuntu for these packages will be::
\verbatim
sudo apt-get install libqtwebkit4 wget zip
\endverbatim

## Mac OS

We are actively working towards an installer for Mac OS.
