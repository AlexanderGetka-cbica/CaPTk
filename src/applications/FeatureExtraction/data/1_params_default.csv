Generic,Quantization,String,Image:ROI,ROI,Whether the quantization of Intensities is supposed to happen on a per-image basis or on a per-ROI basis
Generic,Resampling,mm,0:10,3.0,Resamples all images and masks to this value of voxel/pixel resolution before computations (0: no resampling)
Generic,ResamplingInterpolator_Image,mm,Nearest:Linear:BSpline,Linear,Type of interpolator to use if resampling is happening, ignored if m_resamplingResolution = 0
Generic,ResamplingInterpolator_Mask,mm,Nearest:Linear:BSpline,Nearest,Type of interpolator to use if resampling is happening, ignored if m_resamplingResolution = 0
Intensity,,,,,
Morphologic,Dimension,String,[2D:3D],3D,For calculating 2D slice (maximum area along specified axis) or full 3D volume features
Morphologic,Axis,String,[z:x:y],z,The axis with maximum area for which the 2D slice computation is to be done
Morphologic,Range,Int,(0:1),0,0:largest connected component in ROI; 1: all connected components larger than 5% of total image size
