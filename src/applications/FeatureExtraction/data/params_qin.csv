Generic,Quantization_Type,String,FixedBinNumber:FixedBinSize:Equal,FixedBinNumber,FixedBinNumber (FBN): the bins are uniformly distributed across the minimum and maximum extent in the ROI/Image as defined under "Quantization_Extent"; FixedBinSize (FBS): bins are added in a fixed step between the minimum and maximum extent in the ROI/Image as defined under "Quantization_Extent" the requested size is provided in 'Bins'; Equal: each bin holds an equal number of intensities
Intensity,,,,,
Morphologic,Range,Int,(0:25),0,0:largest connected component in ROI; N: all connected components larger than (N*10^-6) of total image size are taken into account
Volumetric,Dimension,String,[2D:3D],3D,For calculating 2D slice (maximum area along specified axis) or full 3D volume features
GLCM,Bins,Int,,256,
GLCM,Radius,Int,(1:9),1.0,Radius around the center voxel which can be in mm as well (needs to be defined as float in same space as input image/mask)
GLCM,Offset,String,[Individual:Average:Combined],Combined,Either individual offset values or averagedcomputation for individual offsets might not work)
