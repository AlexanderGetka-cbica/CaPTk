Generic,Quantization,String,Image:ROI,ROI,Whether the quantization of Intensities is supposed to happen on a per-image basis or on a per-ROI basis,
Generic,Resampling,mm,00:10,3,Resamples all images and masks to this value of voxel/pixel resolution before computations (0: no resampling): reduce this number of more accuracy,
Generic,ResamplingInterpolator_Image,mm,Nearest:Linear:BSpline,Linear,Type of interpolator to use if resampling is happening, ignored if m_resamplingResolution = 0
Generic,ResamplingInterpolator_Mask,mm,Nearest:Linear:BSpline,Nearest,Type of interpolator to use if resampling is happening, ignored if m_resamplingResolution = 0
Intensity,,,,,,
GLCM,Bins,Int,,6,,
GLCM,Directions,Int,03:26,26,The number of directions around the center voxel to calculate features on,
GLCM,Radius,Int,(1:9),1,Radius around the center voxel which can be in mm as well (needs to be defined as float in same space as input image/mask),
GLCM,Offset,String,[Individual:Average:Combined],Average,Either individual offset values or averaged,
GLCM,Dimension,String,[2D:3D],3D,For calculating 2D slice (maximum area along specified axis) or full 3D volume features,
GLCM,Axis,String,[z:x:y],z,The axis with maximum area for which the 2D slice computation is to be done (keep in mind that single slice computation for individual offsets might not work),
